As you probably well know even Mr. Obama used [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) during [his campaign](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/). Jekyll is a static website generator developed in Ruby. There are actually solutions implemented in other languages, such as [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based [Enfield](https://github.com/fortes/enfield), that aim to be compatible with it. 

> In any case it is probably a good idea to go and [install Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install) now unless you already haven't and get back right after that. Or you just might want to read on. Whatever.

What makes Jekyll interesting is the fact that [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) supports it directly. There are some restrictions. You cannot use custom plugins if you want to use their commit flow for instance. Otherwise it is a surprisingly good and affordable way to host a site.

In this little guide of mine I'll introduce you to my Jekyll workflow. While at it you'll hopefully pick up a couple tricks of trade useful beyond Jekyll. And then there's of course the excellent spoof on that "Yes We Can" thing. Chant with me "Yes We Jekyll!". There we go!

The guide has actually been structured as a Jekyll site so feel free to explore the source. It is still more or less in a state of flux. If you have any ideas on how to improve it, let me know at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bebraw/yeswejekyll/issues). Also [pull requests](https://github.com/bebraw/yeswejekyll/pulls) are appreciated.
